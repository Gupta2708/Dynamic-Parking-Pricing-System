# 🚗 Dynamic Parking Pricing System – Capstone Project

A real-time intelligent pricing engine for urban parking lots that dynamically adjusts prices based on demand, traffic conditions, and occupancy patterns using streaming data processing with the **Pathway** framework.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

This capstone project implements a sophisticated dynamic pricing system for 14 urban parking spaces using real-time data streams. The system employs multiple pricing algorithms to optimize revenue while ensuring competitive pricing strategies.

Built using **Pathway** for streaming technology and **Bokeh** for interactive visualization, it delivers actionable insights for parking lot operators and showcases the practical applications of data science in urban mobility solutions.
